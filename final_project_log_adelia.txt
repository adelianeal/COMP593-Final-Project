- Regretted the fact I didn't start this sooner
- Registered for API Key: OgN20BOtcOfM9Nt8lj8JZzAJbhMkn9C79DYlMZ6p (pasting it so i don't forget it)
- Completed the get_apod_info function
- Completed print_apod_info function
- Started create_image_db function (maybe finished it I actually have no idea)

04-22-2022
- Filled in image_sha256 variable
- Hashlib import wasn't working, so hashlib.sha256() did not work- imported hashlib itself rather than just sha256 and it should work now? The text is colorful so that may be a good sign

04-23-2022
- Finished set_desktop_background_image function

04-24-2022
- Completed download_apod_image function
- Completed save_image_file function
- Didn't actually finish the create_image_db function so fixed that 
- Finished add_image_to_apod function
- Started image_already_in_db function but am confused so I'll try again later
