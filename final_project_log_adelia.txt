- Regretted the fact I didn't start this sooner
- Registered for API Key: OgN20BOtcOfM9Nt8lj8JZzAJbhMkn9C79DYlMZ6p (pasting it so i don't forget it)
- Completed the get_apod_info function
- Completed print_apod_info function
- Started create_image_db function (maybe finished it I actually have no idea)

04-22-2022
- Filled in image_sha256 variable
- Hashlib import wasn't working, so hashlib.sha256() did not work- imported hashlib itself rather than just sha256 and it should work now? The text is colorful so that may be a good sign

04-23-2022
- Finished set_desktop_background_image function

04-24-2022
- Completed download_apod_image function
- Completed save_image_file function
- Didn't actually finish the create_image_db function so fixed that 
- Finished add_image_to_apod function
- Started image_already_in_db function but am confused so I'll try again later (edit: was confused for a while...)

04-26-2022
- Completed get_image_path function
- Completed image_already_in_db function (Spoiler alert: it wasn't right)
- At this point, all TODOs have been filled in, but I'm not sure what works and what doesn't so now it's time to debug  
- Got an error about a module object not being subscriptable. It turns out the dictionary was not being returned correctly due to missing () after json
- Fixed that, but am getting this: The SHA-256 of the image is:  <sha256 _hashlib.HASH object @ 0x000001F595E248B0> 
    - The actual SHA256 is meant to be printed after the statement. I think something is missing. Possibly hexdigest() 
    - That was the issue thankfully so that part is functional now
- My select statement is wrong- keep getting sqlite3 operational errors
    - The value I want to look for is apparently not a column. Like yeah, that's the whole point?

04-28-2022
- Still tried to fix the SQL query
    - The newest issue is TypeError: execute() argument 1 must be str, not tuple
    - Not gonna lie, this was frustrating
    - Pretty sure I visited every page on StackOverflow 

04-29-2022
- I finally fixed the SQL query (thank you for the help!)
    - added a variable to make image_sha256 a list, which was passed into execute() and didn't throw an error
- Realised the save_image_file function was also checking if the image_sha256 was already in the database and was getting a missing parameter error. 
    - Thought I fixed the function, as my desktop background changed and there were no errors. But the screen was black.
    - Turns out the image wasn't being saved, as I was missing the image content. Fixed that and it works as it should!
- Edited the update messages that will be shown as the script runs
- Realised I forgot to include the date/time the image was downloaded at in the database- error about datetime needing an argument so I decided to just create a timestamp instead
- Triple checked to make sure everything worked properly and that all requirements have been met (I think they have?)
