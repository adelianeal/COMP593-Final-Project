- Regretted the fact I didn't start this sooner
- Registered for API Key: OgN20BOtcOfM9Nt8lj8JZzAJbhMkn9C79DYlMZ6p (pasting it so i don't forget it)
- Completed the get_apod_info function
- Completed print_apod_info function
- Started create_image_db function (maybe finished it I actually have no idea)

04-22-2022
- Filled in image_sha256 variable
- Hashlib import wasn't working, so hashlib.sha256() did not work- imported hashlib itself rather than just sha256 and it should work now? The text is colorful so that may be a good sign

04-23-2022
- Finished set_desktop_background_image function

04-24-2022
- Completed download_apod_image function
- Completed save_image_file function
- Didn't actually finish the create_image_db function so fixed that 
- Finished add_image_to_apod function
- Started image_already_in_db function but am confused so I'll try again later

04-26-2022
- Completed get_image_path function
- Completed image_already_in_db function
- At this point, all TODOs have been filled in, but I'm not sure what works and what doesn't so now it's time to debug  
- Got an error about a module object not being subscriptable. It turns out the dictionary was not being returned correctly due to missing () 
- Fixed that, but am getting this: The SHA-256 of the image is:  <sha256 _hashlib.HASH object @ 0x000001F595E248B0> 
    - The actual SHA256 is meant to be printed after the statement. I think something is missing. Possibly hexdigest() 
    - That was the issue thankfully so that part is solved
- My select statement is wrong- keep getting sqlite3 operational errors
    - The value I want to look for is apparently not a column. Like yeah, that's the whole point?
