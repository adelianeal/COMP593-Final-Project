- Regretted the fact I didn't start this sooner
- Registered for API Key: OgN20BOtcOfM9Nt8lj8JZzAJbhMkn9C79DYlMZ6p (pasting it so i don't forget it)
- Completed the get_apod_info function
- Completed print_apod_info function
- Started create_image_db function (maybe finished it I actually have no idea)

- Filled in image_sha256
- Hashlib import wasn't working, so hashlib.sha256() did not work- imported hashlib itself rather than just sha256 and it should work now? The text is colorful so that may be a good sign
